### What is this?

This place is a structured template for my repositories from hereforth, generic enough to be used for pretty much anything!

### Well... what makes it so special?

It has many things preconfigured out of the box! These things include:

-   [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
-   A formatted readme, that you are reading now!
-   [Issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)
-   [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot)
-   Some [vscode](https://github.com/dependabot) settings
-   [Request Info](https://probot.github.io/apps/request-info/)
-   [Stale](https://github.com/actions/stale/)
